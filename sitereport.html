    <h1>Site Report</h1>
    <p>My journey into web development has been both exhilarating and challenging. At the outset, delving into coding and design felt like an exciting adventure waiting to unfold. As I began to write code and bring my ideas to life, the sense of accomplishment and creativity fueled my motivation to delve deeper into the world of web development. However, amidst the enthusiasm, I encountered my fair share of hurdles. With a limited timeframe and other academic commitments, refining the design aspects of my websites proved to be a daunting task. Debugging, in particular, presented its own set of challenges, especially since I am not an HTML expert. The process of identifying and rectifying errors was often time-consuming, and the auto-correction feature of online platforms added to the complexity. To ensure the validity of my code, I relied on external validation tools like https://validator.w3.org/, which helped streamline the debugging process to some extent.

In terms of design decisions, I opted for a simple yet versatile cloudy blue background. This choice was deliberate as it provided a contrasting backdrop for a wide range of font colors, enhancing readability for users. Although the design of my websites could have been more polished given more time, I am proud of the progress I have made. Moving forward, I aim to further hone my coding skills and explore advanced design concepts to create more visually captivating and technically robust websites.
